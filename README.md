# SchoolApp (Still in Progress)

A school dashboard application using Angular 9 and Firebase.\
Categorised the user base into three segments: \
-Admin -Student -Teacher

# Features:

For every entity I have divided the features that they can make use of
1. Admin:
* Can add a user based on their role
* Add an event which will be displayed to other profiles as well
* I have considered the School Principle as Admin, thus he/she can gets to see the overall performance on class basis

2. Students:
* They can edit their profile, maintain their details and will get all the necessary details in their dashboard
* Students can check for the upcoming events, ongoing topics on subject basis and also record their achievements.
* They will be notified about their academic performances and the reamrks that they been given by their teachers.

3. Teachers:
* Through their Dashboard they can also edit and maintain their details.
* Teachers can update the activity tracker tp notify the students about the ongoing topics.
* Teachers can also add marks and attendance for each student.
